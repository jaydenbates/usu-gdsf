# Frontend Testing Readme

This is what I've figured out so far:

tests are called 'specs'
`describe()` is a function to group related tests
`it()` is a single test - this is where you put the expectations


run `npx jasmine` to run the front end tests
There are a few examples that were part of the initial setup for you to look at.
